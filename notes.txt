full experiment drop outs only without augmentation

#Experiment Parameters
ablation_size=None
batch_size=30
num_epochs=10
dim=(120,120)
samples=20

training accuracy = 49%,val accuracy is 55%
The model is not learning, slow inc. in accuracy observed
augmentatin has no impact, which means its not incorrect as well
training time 100s

without dropouts full experiment, without augmentation
same parameters as above, ta = 60, va = 53

without dropouts full experiment, with augmentation
the model is not learnng ta = 51 and va = 49

exponential decay introduced, loss increased - need to revisit if this is applied correctly

reduced one layer, ta = 65 va = 46 the model is still learning netter

20 epochs - ta = 79, va = 60 (early stopping at 18)

reintroduced 4th layer, included dropouts, ran the same experiment above with 15 epochs, 30 samples, TA 48, VA 50 - MODEL NOT LEARNING

increased dense layer to 256
